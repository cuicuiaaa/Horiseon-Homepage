# Horiseon-Homepage

The project is to refector the former code without any change of the visual look and actual content of the website.

The main change I did in the project is to
- make HTML elements semantic
- make sure elements are in a logical structure
- consolidate CSS selectors and properties
- add alt attributes to all image elements
- give a title to the page
- add comments to make the code more readable
